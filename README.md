DeepQ2048
===========

My attempt to train a Deep Q Neural Network to learn to play 2048. I am using
a modified version of the python implementation of 2048 as the environment created by
- [Tay Yang Shun](http://github.com/yangshun)
- [Emmanuel Goh](http://github.com/emman27)





Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli, here is a Python version that uses TKinter.

To start the game, run:

    $ python3 puzzle.py
